# ot
Automate everything!
## Getting Started
Take a look at [this projects own otlist.json](https://github.com/finngreiter/ot/blob/master/otlist.json).
as you can see, there are two tasks, ```gitThing``` and ```sayHello```. Inside these tasks there is a list of terminal commands to execute. For example, when you run ```ot sayHello``` in the terminal, ot runs the list of commands (echo Hello and echo World) one by one.
Simple as that!
